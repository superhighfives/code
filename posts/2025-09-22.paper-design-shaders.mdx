title: Adding beautiful shaders to your site with paper-design/shaders
description: I've been playing around with Paper Shaders lately, and it's honestly refreshing to find a shader library that doesn't make you jump through hoops. Here's what makes it worth checking out.

I've used shaders, GPU-backed canvasesâ€”in a [bunch of my projects](https://lysterfieldlake.com). While I love them, I've always been a bit frustrated by the boilerplate for setting up simple ones. The visual possibilities are endless, but there's a steep learning curve and a bunch of setup complexity. That's why [paper-design/shaders](https://github.com/paper-design/shaders) is great. Zero-dependency shaders out of the box.

## Getting it running

The setup is refreshingly simple. Just grab the package that matches your environment:

```bash
# For React projects
npm i @paper-design/shaders-react

# For vanilla JavaScript
npm i @paper-design/shaders
```

## Examples that actually work

Let me show you a couple of ways I've been using Paper Shaders:

### React: Animated mesh gradient

This one creates a flowing, organic background effect that works great for hero sections.

Here's what that looks like in action:

```jsx live
import { MeshGradient } from '@paper-design/shaders-react' // ^0.0.55

export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="relative h-full">
      <MeshGradient
        colors={['#5100ff', '#00ff80', '#ffcc00', '#ea00ff']}
        distortion={1}
        swirl={0.8}
        speed={0.2}
        height='100%'
      />
      <div className="absolute inset-0 flex items-center justify-center">
        ðŸ‘‹
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Vanilla JavaScript: Custom shader effect

For non-React projects, the vanilla JavaScript approach is just as straightforward:

```javascript
import { createShader } from '@paper-design/shaders'

const canvas = document.querySelector('#shader-canvas')
const shader = createShader(canvas, {
  type: 'dithering',
  colors: ['#ff6b6b', '#4ecdc4', '#45b7d1'],
  intensity: 0.5,
  speed: 0.1
})

// Start the animation
shader.start()
```

The library comes with various shader effects - mesh gradients, dithering, dot orbit, warp effects, and more. Each one lets you tweak settings through props or configuration objects, so you can dial in exactly the look you're after.

## Why I think you'll like it

Paper Shaders hits that sweet spot I'm always looking for - powerful enough for real work but simple enough that I can mess around with it on a weekend without getting bogged down in setup. The zero-dependency approach means you're not taking on technical debt, and the performance focus means your effects won't turn someone's phone into a space heater.

If you want to check it out, the [documentation and examples at shaders.paper.design](https://shaders.paper.design) are pretty solid, and you can poke around the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/paper-design/shaders) to see what's under the hood.
