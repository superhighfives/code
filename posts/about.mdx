## Hello, I'm Charlie.

In my spare time I like to work on micro projects, from [tools for creative coding](https://sandpitjs.com/), to [tweet-based music videos](http://tweetflight.wearebrightly.com/), to [design-focused macOS apps](https://superhighfives.com/pika). I also sometimes write about [development](https://medium.com/superhighfives), contribute to [open source](https://github.com/superhighfives/), and share [resources](https://dribbble.com/superhighfives).

My work has been featured by Google's Creative Sandbox, and has received numerous awards, including from [Awwwards](https://thefwa.com/profiles/charlie-gleason) and [the FWA](https://thefwa.com/profiles/charlie-gleason).

I believe there are few things more comforting than good documentation.
