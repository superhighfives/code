# Hello World

This is a **hello world** MDX file that demonstrates the functionality of our MDX integration with React Router 7 and Cloudflare Workers.

## Features

This implementation supports:

- Frontmatter attributes
- Custom components
- Pre-rendering
- Cloudflare Workers deployment

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component:

```jsx
function HelloWorld() {
  return <div>Hello from MDX!</div>
}
```

## Custom Components

You can use custom components in your MDX files:
