# Getting Started with MDX

Welcome to our MDX integration! This guide will show you how to create and manage MDX content in your React Router 7 application.

## Installation

The MDX integration is already set up in this project. Here's what we've configured:

1. **Server-side processing**: MDX files are processed at build time
2. **Client-side rendering**: React components render your MDX content
3. **Pre-rendering**: Static pages are generated for better performance

## Creating Content

To create a new MDX file:

1. Add a `.mdx` file to the `posts/` directory
2. Include frontmatter with metadata:

```yaml
---
title: Your Title
description: A brief description
author: Your Name
publishedAt: 2025-01-01
tags: [tag1, tag2]
---
```

3. Write your content using Markdown and JSX

## Frontmatter Support

Our implementation supports rich frontmatter data that can be accessed in your React components:

- **title**: Page title
- **description**: Meta description
- **author**: Content author
- **publishedAt**: Publication date
- **tags**: Array of tags

## Custom Components

You can use custom React components in your MDX:

<YouTube id="example123" />

This allows for rich, interactive content within your markdown.
