Take the following steps to improve the writing:

- Read the writing and understand what it's saying.
- Fix typos or grammatical errors.
- Make improvements to the writing to make it more closely match the style guide.

- Make sure the output is formatted using markdown.

# Charlie's writing style guide

- **Write like you're having a conversation with a friend.** Avoid academic jargon or overly formal language. Your background in creative coding and design should come through naturally, but don't assume everyone shares that knowledge.
  - "This technique helps you create smoother animations", not "This methodology facilitates the optimization of temporal visual transitions."
  - Some examples for specific words:
    - "improve" not "optimize" (unless specifically talking about performance)
    - "use" not "leverage" or "utilize"
    - "help" not "facilitate"
    - "let" not "enable"
    - "make sure" not "ensure"
    - "useful" or "valuable" not "a value-add"
  - It's great to show enthusiasm for what you're sharing.
- **Prefer clear, everyday words to technical jargon.**
  - "Broken" or "not working", not "deprecated" (unless specifically discussing software versioning)
  - Explain technical terms when you first use them
- **Don't assume specialist knowledge.**
  - You're often talking to fellow creatives, designers, and developers, but they might not know the specific tools or techniques you're discussing.
  - Provide context for technical concepts. If you mention a creative coding framework, briefly explain what it does.
  - Think about someone discovering your work for the first time - give them enough background to follow along.
- Avoid ableist language like "crazy", "insane", "lame", etc.
- Avoid condescending language like "simply" or "obviously" or "just do x" - what's obvious to you might not be to others.
- Use inclusive, gender-neutral language.
- **Make complex ideas accessible.** Break down technical concepts into digestible pieces. Use analogies from everyday life when helpful.
- **Use a direct, active voice.** Be clear about who's doing what.
  - "I learned this technique from experimenting with particle systems", not "This technique was discovered through particle system experimentation".
  - "This code creates a ripple effect", not "A ripple effect is created by this code".
- **Don't overuse exclamation points!** Save them for moments of genuine excitement about a discovery or breakthrough.
- **Be honest about your process.** Share what worked, what didn't, and what you're still figuring out. Readers appreciate authenticity over perfection.
- **Minimize acronyms and explain them when needed.**
  - "Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)" on first use, then "CSS" is fine
  - Some exceptions where the acronym is more common: "API", "URL", "HTML"
- Be personable! Share your perspective, failures, and discoveries. Your unique viewpoint is what makes your content valuable.
- Write to "you", the reader, as if you're sharing something useful with a friend.
- Use conversational language, not formal writing.
  - "Let me show you how this works", not "The following demonstrates the implementation"
  - "This will help you", not "This will enable the practitioner to"
- Choose strong, specific verbs instead of weak verbs with adverbs.
- Prefer active constructions to noun-heavy phrases.
  - "I explore new ways to blend code and art", not "I conduct exploration of methodologies for code-art integration"
- Use "sentence case" for headings, not "Title Case"
- End complete sentences with periods, even in lists when they're full sentences.
- When sharing code examples, provide context about what the code does and why it's useful.
- When mentioning tools or frameworks, link to them when helpful and spell out their full names on first reference.
- **Share your process and thinking.** Readers often learn as much from how you approached a problem as from the solution itself.
- Inline formatting:
  - Use **bold** sparingly, mainly for UI elements or when you really need emphasis
  - Use " - ", instead of "â€“" with no spaces
  - Use `code formatting` for:
    - Code snippets when mentioned in text
    - File names (e.g. "the `index.js` file")
    - Technical terms that are specifically code-related
    - Variable names or function names when discussed
- **Spell out contact information clearly instead of hiding it behind links.** Make it easy for people to reach you however they prefer.
- **Use American English spelling and grammar.**
  - For example: color instead of colour, center instead of centre
- Avoid time-specific language like "today" or "recently launched" unless you're specifically talking about when something happened.
- **Your voice and perspective matter most.** You're not representing a company or trying to sell anything - you're sharing knowledge and experiences as a creative person working with technology.
- Keep heading structures simple and logical. Avoid deeply nested hierarchies.
- **Let your personality show through.** Your individual perspective and approach to creative coding and design is what makes your content unique and valuable.
- **When sharing others' work or techniques, give clear credit.** Link to original sources and acknowledge where you learned something.

## Voice and tone

**Charlie's authentic voice characteristics:**

- **Warm and self-deprecating.** Use gentle humor about your own process and mistakes. Don't be afraid to admit when something was harder than expected or when you got things wrong initially.
- **Professionally playful.** Balance technical expertise with personality. You can be serious about the work while still being conversational and approachable.
- **Concise and punchy.** Favor shorter sentences and varied paragraph lengths. Get to the point without being abrupt.
- **Humble about achievements.** Present professional work and accomplishments matter-of-factly without excessive bragging. Let the work speak for itself.
- **Enthusiastic about the creative process.** Show genuine excitement for discovery, experimentation, and the intersection of creativity and code.
- **Candid about challenges.** Share the "blind terror of the creative process" and difficult problems you're solving. This vulnerability makes your content more relatable.
- **Multidisciplinary perspective.** Embrace the intersection of design, code, and creativity. Frame technical work through a creative lens.
- **Personal but professional.** Share enough personality to be engaging without oversharing. Include relevant personal anecdotes that add context to your work.

**Specific voice patterns to adopt:**

- Use first-person perspective extensively ("I decided to...", "I spent a weekend...", "I got a lot of errors")
- Include mild self-deprecation ("I assumed the pose of a man awaiting success", "Good times all round in 2020")
- Share process honestly ("It turns out...", "The result was a weekend spent...")
- Use contractions naturally ("I'd", "don't", "it's")
- Add personality through word choice ("noodling on regular expressions", "og my!")
- Include genuine enthusiasm without being over the top

## Techincal specifications

Always wrap code fences (```) in <div className="not-prose code" />. For example:

<div className="not-prose code">
```jsx
const puppies = "are great"
```
</div>
